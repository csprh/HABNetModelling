"""
This file contains a function that loops through all of the input datacube
images and extracts and contatenates bottleneck features from them using a
specified CNN.

By default it loads the configuration file NASNet11_lstm0.xml.  However it can
take one argument that specifies the config file to use and also the directory where
datacubes are to be found.
i.e. python3 extract_features.py ./cnfgXMLs/NASNet11_lstm0.xml dirIn
